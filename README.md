## ðŸ•¶ About me

I am a high school student in China.

I'm constantly exploring the world of technology and trying interesting things along the way.

I put the programs I developed and thought were worth releasing as open source on GitHub. You can find them below this text.

## ðŸ“ƒ Experience

<!--<details>
  <summary>A boring prologue, click to view.</summary>

> I have left a link to this page in profiles of many of my social media accounts. Not only does it show my computer skills (even if from this page you can't tell how high they are), but it also makes it easy for others to verify my identity.

> As you can see, I am Chinese, so the main visitors of my profile should be Chinese users. As for why I wrote in English, on the one hand, this platform is for the whole world, I think I should use a language with a wider coverage, and on the other hand, I donâ€™t want my classmates to easily remember these words and mention them everywhere in school, mainly the latter. Fortunately this has never happened.

> Without further ado, let me introduce myself.

<!--When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, around April 2018, I tried [LabVIEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) on a Windows 7 laptop at home. It was a program my mom used at work. Because it was graphical, I could "write" some small gadgets with it without any programming experience. Of course, it was obviously impossible to start with such a professional and large software, let alone for an elementary school student. So the following thing happened.-->

I've been programming in **[Easy Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Programming_Language)** for a long time, and before that, I was programming in **[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)**. Then I started writing **Python** and very **simple C/C++**.

In May 2022, I set up [my blog](https://www.yuanzj.top/) and have been running it ever since. After that, I started **web programming**. I used **JavaScript** to write the frontend, **PHP** to write the backend. I wrote some web projects, installed themes and plugins for my blog. My blog has been joined many projects: [Travellings](https://github.com/travellings-link/travellings), [ForeverBlog](https://foreverblog.cn/blog/5213.html), [StoreWeb.cn](https://storeweb.cn/site/o/1815), [BlogFinder](https://bf.zzxworld.com/s/690).

In other aspects, I have installed systems on my computer many times. I once installed MS-DOS 7.10, Windows 98, XP, Vista, Android-x86 on VMware, Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11 on my laptop. I have installed dual systems of Windows 7 with 10, then Windows 10 with Ubuntu 22.04 on my computer at home. I once reinstalled the system on my router and rooted my old Redmi phone.

In February 2023, I signed up for Telegram and began exploring other *foreign websites* (many of them are blocked by [GFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall)), including registering a lot of useless email addresses and several forum accounts.

ðŸ—º The rest of the experience is not very technical. If you want to know more, please visit my blog, which is only available in Chinese.
